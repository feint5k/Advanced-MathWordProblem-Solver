## Introduction to Advanced Math Word Problem Solver

This software uses Natural Language Processing to solve Math word problems. Our approach forms an English corpus of arithmetic word problems, creates equation templates, performs normalizing equations, and experimentally evaluates T-RNN and retrieval baselines.

### Contributions
- Creation of 'Dolphin300', a unique English corpus of arithmetic word problems.
- Development of equation templates and normalizing equations on par with the Math23K dataset [1].
- Evaluation of T-RNN and retrieval baselines on Math2
